        Hi, I'm Will Wu, a computer science student at Queen's University. I
        have a passion for software development and enjoy working on
        challenging projects. My interests include web development, artificial
        intelligence, and exploring new technologies. In my free time, I love to
        travel and experience new cultures.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in continuous learning and am always looking for opportunities
        to expand my skill set and knowledge. Feel free to connect with me on
